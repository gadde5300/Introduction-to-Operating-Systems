# Problem 9: RPC Data Types

A RPC routine get_coordinates() returns the N-dimensional coordinates of a data point, where each coordinate is an integer.

Write the elements of the C data structure that corresponds to the 3D coordinates of a data point.

A: We would need an `int len` and `int * val` to correspond to 3S coordinates of a data point.
