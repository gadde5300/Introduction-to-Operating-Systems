# Problem 3: Hardware Counters

Consider a quad-core machine with a single memory module connected to the CPU's via a shared *bus*. On this machine, a CPU instruction takes 1 cycle, and a memory instruction takes 4 cycles.

The machine has two hardware counters:

- Counter that measures IPC
- Counter that measures CPI

Answer the following:

1. What does IPC stand for in this context?
2. What does CPI stand for in this context?
3. What is the highest IPC on this machine?
4. What is the highest CPI on this machine?
