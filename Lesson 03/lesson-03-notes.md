## Lesson 3: Introduction to Operating Systems

* Topics to be covered in this lesson:
  * What is an OS (operating system)?
  * What are key components of an OS?
  * Design and implementation considerations of OSs

### What is an Operating System?
* An OS is a special piece of software that abstracts and arbitrates the use of a computer system
* An OS is like a toy shop manager in that an OS:
  * Directs operational resources
  * Enforces working policies
  * Mitigates difficulty of complex tasks
* By definition, an OS is a layer of systems software that:
  * Directly has privileged access to the underlying hardware
  * Hides the hardware complexity
  * Manages hardware on behalf of one of more applications according to some predefined polices
  * In addition, it ensures that applications are isolated and protected from one another
