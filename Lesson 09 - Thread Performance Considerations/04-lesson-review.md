# Quiz 4: Lesson Review

What did you learn in this lesson?

A: In this lesson, we learned about performance comparisons between MP, MT, and event-driven models. We also learned about event-driven architectures such as Flash and compared it against Apache web server. We learned comparisons depend on metrics, AMPED and AMTED architectures, experimental methodology, and designing and running experiments.
