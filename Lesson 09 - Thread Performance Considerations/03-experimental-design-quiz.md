# Quiz 3: Experimental Design

A toy shop manager wants to determine how many workers to hire to be able to handle the **worst case** scenario. Orders range in difficulty from _blocks_ to _teddy bears_ to _trains_. The shop has _three working areas_, each with tools for any toy.

Which of the following **experiments** (types of orders, number of workers) will allow us to make meaningful conclusions about the manager's question?

- Configuration 1: `{ (train, 3), (train, 4), (train, 5) }`
- Configuration 2: `{ (blocks, 3), (bears, 6), (train, 9) }`
- Configuration 3: `{ (mixed, 3), (mixed, 6), (mixed, 9) }`
- Configuration 4: `{ (train, 3), (train, 6), (train, 9) }`

A: Configuration 4 is valid since there is a sequence of trains (worst case) with a variation of a number of workers (adding three each time).
