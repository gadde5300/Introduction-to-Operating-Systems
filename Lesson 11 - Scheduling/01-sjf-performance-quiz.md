# Quiz 1: SJF Performance

Assume SJF is used to schedule tasks _T1_, _T2_, and _T3_. Also make the following assumptions:

- Scheduler does not preempt tasks
- Known execution times: _T1_ = 1 s, _T2_ = 10 s, _T3_ = 1s
- All arrive at the same time t = 0

Calculate the **throughput**, **average completion time**, and **average wait time**.

A: The answers are, respectively, **0.25 tasks/sec**, **5 sec**, and **1 sec**
